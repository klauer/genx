********************************
Welcome to GenX's documentation!
********************************

GenX is a tool to refine x-ray, neutron reflectivity data as well as surface x-ray diffraction data written in Python.
The refinement is
conducted with an optimization algorithm called differential evolution which is very robust. The model in GenX
is defined through a scripting. However, for reflectivity measurements a graphical plugin is available to
make it more user friendly.

The documentation is based on tutorials as well as more in depth description of the program. Below you can find the
table of contents. It is recommended, for the beginner, to start with the tutorials.

I hope I will get help from users to update and correct the manuals and tutorials I add here. If you find some errors or
something that is missing please correct it! If you miss a page please contact me and we can discuss if and where
it should be added.
