		<h2>What is GenX ?</h2>
		<p>GenX is a versatile program using the differential evolution algorithm for 
		fitting X-ray and neutron reflectivity data. It utilizes the Parratt recursion 
		formula for simulating specular reflectivity. The program is easily extensible
		, allowing users to incorporate their own models into the program. This can be 
		useful for fitting data from other scattering experiments, or for any other 
		minimization problem which has a large number of input parameters and/or contains 
		many local minima, where the differential evolution algorithm is suitable. 
		In addition, GenX manages to fit an arbitrary number of data sets 
		simultaneously. A detailed description has been published in 
		<a href="http://www.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?aj5091">J. Appl. Cryst. 40, 1174 (2007)</a> </p>
		
		<h2>How to use it?</h2>		
		<p>GenX is written in <a href="http://www.python.org">python</a> and uses the 
		<a href="hhtp://www.wxpython.org">wxpython</a> package for the Graphical User Interface (GUI).
		The program is perhaps best described as integrated development environment for 
		<a href="Screenshot.png"><img src="Screenshot_tumbnail.png" width="253" height="158" 
		border="3" alt="Screenshot" align="right"/></a> 
		building scattering/reflectivity models. In the basic configuration the user writes
		a script which defines the physical model of the sample and instrument.		
		This is
		then loaded into the fitting environment and the user defined parameters can be fitted.</p>
	
		

		<p>The new version of GenX contains several improvements in comparison to the older.
		Most noteworthy are a plugin architecture for add-ons and data loaders as well as new GUI design
		with easier handling of large data sets. The add-on feature allows expert users to create
		problem specific GUI components. For example, right know a GUI for defining multilayered sampled
		for reflectivity is being developed. The data loaders allow different type of data to be loaded
		by writing plugins that take care of that part. Both of these components can be changed run time.</p>
